# ReOpen-Tracker - Fixed
I wanted to share a file but any of the trackers couldn't accept my file since it's illegal, default trackers like opentrackr could ban me, so I decided to open my own tracker.
The thing is, I don't want to import MySQL, cause I hate it for its complexity and memory consumption, maybe in the future I'll change my mind, @amereservant did a great job, all credits to him.
Maybe a couple for me ;-).
<br>I wasn't able to start it from the first time, so->

Fixed some errors for SQLite:
1. Wasn't able to create a database, so I put my own created database
2. Integer variable wasn't set
3. Functions file was starting with <? instead of <?php
<br>
I'm not a programmer, and I like to download and run, I know it is a destructive feature, but I don't have time to fully learn PHP :).<br>
All you need to do is to install it on hosting and add tracker url to your torrent file (don't forget to change permissions, where Reopen runs, into 777).<br>
Good luck and good start.
